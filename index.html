            <p>I'm Andrew. I'm 27, have a dog named Tucker, and I'm excited about coding at Code Fellows!</p>
            <p>More about me: I graduated in 2014 from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I worked in the automotive manufacturing for 4.5 years, including a year in China at a factory there. Seattle is where I grew up, but my China trip was an amazing experience and I hope to return some time this year to see friends and enjoy the food.</p>
            <p>I enjoy engineering, whether its mechanical or software. Even in mechanical engineering, coding skills are becoming more and more valuable. I want to use my Code Fellows education to further my career in tech. I hope graduate Code Fellows with flying colors and start working for Microsoft, Zillow, or Wizards of the Coast!</p>
